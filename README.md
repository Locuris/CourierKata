# CourierKata

Fairly pleased with my initial implementation but ran out of time during the discount sorting.

I know I need to create a grid of possible discounts and parcels used within them to determine the best savings from all discount combinations. I'm sure if I had more time I could research the best method to perform this sort of task.

With more time I would also have added proper usage comments to each of the public methods and classes.

I may have also considered a better configuration method for setting the price constants for values rather than hard coding them.
